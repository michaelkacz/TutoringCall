# WebRTC-App

WEB RTC APPLICATION: Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I created a peer-to-peer web application. This application is capable of one-toone video calling with audio incorporated using video and audio tracks. With randomly generated namespaces, the two users had a private connection through a socket.io server that allowed them to securely communicate.
